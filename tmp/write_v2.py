PURPOSE:
  Generate a complete, exhaustive keyword list for a given category
  covering ALL levels of knowledge — from absolute beginner who has
  never heard of the domain, all the way to the creator who designs
  the technology itself.

  Zero to hero. Novice to exceptional. Practitioner to god-level.

  The output is a structured keyword list ready to feed into
  dictionary entry generation (Master Prompt v3.0).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 1: KNOWLEDGE LEVEL FRAMEWORK — 7 LEVELS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Every category must be covered across SEVEN levels plus a META layer.
Each level has a precise identity, need profile, and test question.

  L3   ★★☆+  Intermediate     — Design decisions and trade-offs
  L4   ★★★   Expert           — Production ownership and diagnosis
  L4.5 🔥    Architect        — System-level innovation and governance
  L5   🔬    Creator          — Theory, specification, and invention
  META 🧠    Meta-Skills      — Transferable god-level thinking patterns

META-SKILLS LAYER  🧠  (Appended after L5)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  NEW IN v2.0

  WHO:
    Not a standard keyword level — a supplementary
    layer appended after L5. Captures the THINKING
    PATTERNS that emerge from deep mastery of the domain.

  WHAT IT COVERS:
    - Pattern recognition across technologies
    - First-principles reasoning from invariants
    - Adversarial or threat thinking
    - System thinking (emergent behaviour)
    - Teaching ability (explain at any level)
    - Cross-domain transfer (applying lessons
      from one technology to another)

  HOW TO USE:
    After generating L5 keywords, add a META-SKILLS
    section with 3–5 keywords capturing transferable
    thinking patterns unique to mastery of this domain.

    These are NOT technology-specific procedures.
    They are the cognitive tools the expert applies
    even when the specific technology changes.

  EXAMPLES:
    Security:    "Adversarial Thinking as a Design Tool"
                 "Trust Boundary Analysis"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2: KEYWORD GENERATION RULES — 16 RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RULE 1: COVERAGE MUST BE COMPLETE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  For EVERY level, ask:
    "Is there any concept at this level that
     a practitioner would encounter that is
     NOT in this list?"

  If yes: add it.
  Do not self-censor for length.
  A complete list is better than a short list.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RULE 2: KEYWORDS MUST BE ATOMIC
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Each keyword = one concept.
  Not "authentication and authorisation" — split it.
  Not "GET, POST, PUT methods" — one per line.
  Not "Spring Boot configuration and tuning" — split it.

  Exception: tightly coupled pairs always taught together:
    "Encoding vs Encryption vs Hashing"
    "var vs let vs const"
    "Stack vs Heap"
  These may stay as one keyword.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RULE 3: DIFFICULTY AND LEVEL COLUMNS ARE BOTH REQUIRED
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The output table MUST have BOTH a Level column
  and a Difficulty column. This resolves the L2/L3
  star-collision that existed in v1.0.

  LEVEL COLUMN (generator-internal, always shown):
    L0    — Orientation
    L1    — Foundational
    L2    — Working
    L3    — Intermediate
    L4    — Expert
    L4.5  — Architect
    L5    — Creator
    META  — Meta-Skills

  DIFFICULTY COLUMN (maps to dictionary entry field):
    L0          →  🌱
    L1          →  ★☆☆
    L2          →  ★★☆
    L3          →  ★★☆   (same stars as L2; Level column disambiguates)
    L4          →  ★★★
    L4.5        →  🔥
    L5          →  🔬

  In the dictionary entry YAML frontmatter:
    L0, L1      →  difficulty: ★☆☆
    L2, L3      →  difficulty: ★★☆
    L4, L4.5    →  difficulty: ★★★
    L5          →  difficulty: ★★★

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RULE 4: KEYWORDS BUILD ON EACH OTHER
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Each level assumes complete knowledge of all levels below.
  The list MUST be learnable in strict order:
  L0 → L1 → L2 → L3 → L4 → L4.5 → L5 → META.

  No L3 keyword should require L4 knowledge to understand.
  No L2 keyword should require L3 knowledge to understand.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RULE 5: INCLUDE ALL SIX KNOWLEDGE DIMENSIONS  [EXPANDED v2.0]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  For each level, ensure coverage of ALL six:

  Each keyword appears EXACTLY ONCE.
  If a concept is both foundational and deep:
    Place it at its FIRST introduction level.
    Later levels build on it without re-listing it.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RULE 9: IDs ARE ASSIGNED SEQUENTIALLY WITHIN CATEGORY
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Use the category code from Master Prompt v3.0.
  Start at [CODE]-001 if new category.
  Continue from last ID if extending existing.
  IDs are assigned in level order within each level
  (all L0 keywords first, then L1, then L2, etc.)

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RULE 10: ANTI-PATTERN KEYWORDS MANDATORY AT EVERY LEVEL  [NEW v2.0]

  ALWAYS list the most widely used name first,
  with aliases in parentheses:
    "mTLS (Mutual TLS)"
    "RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)"
    "CSP (Content Security Policy)"

  When a concept has a formal name and a colloquial name,
  use the formal name as the title, colloquial as alias:

          to design organisational strategy?
  ☐ L5: Does list cover what a creator needs
        to redesign or extend the technology?
  ☐ META: Are 3–5 transferable thinking patterns captured?

CHECK 2 — BALANCE:

CHECK 4 — ATOMICITY:
  ☐ Each keyword is a single concept
  ☐ No keyword is a category (too broad)
  ☐ No keyword is a trivial sub-concept
    of another keyword on the same level
  ☐ Synonyms handled correctly per Rule 14:
    one keyword with aliases in parentheses

CHECK 5 — ID INTEGRITY:
  ☐ IDs are sequential, no gaps
  ☐ Code matches category from registry
  ☐ Starts at correct number
    (001 if new, continues if extending)

CHECK 6 — LEARNING ORDER:
  ☐ L0 keywords require NO prior tech knowledge
  ☐ L1 keywords do not require L2+ knowledge
  ☐ L2 keywords do not require L3+ knowledge
  ☐ Each level is learnable without skipping ahead

CHECK 7 — RECENCY:
  ☐ No keyword is for a technology that is
    officially deprecated or dead
    (mark it historical if it must be included:
     "[Name] (Historical — deprecated YYYY)")
  ☐ Migration keywords reflect current best practice
  ☐ Compliance keywords reflect current regulations
  ☐ Landmark incidents are factually accurate (verify years)

CHECK 8 — REDUNDANCY:
  ☐ No keyword is better placed in another category
  ☐ Cross-category dependencies in Section 3.7
    are complete and accurate

CHECK 9 — PRACTICAL vs THEORETICAL BALANCE:
  ☐ L0–L2: At least 70% practical keywords
    (real things you do or use, not pure theory)
  ☐ L4–L5: At least 30% theoretical keywords
    (internals, algorithms, research)
  ☐ L3: Roughly equal practical and theoretical

CHECK 10 — CONFUSION PAIRS:
  ☐ All concept pairs practitioners commonly confuse
    are listed in Section 3.8
  ☐ Each pair has a clear one-line key difference
  ☐ Every pair in Section 3.8 has both members
    as keywords somewhere in the list
