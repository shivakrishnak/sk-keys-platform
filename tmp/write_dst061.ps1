# DST-061 - CRDT

⚡ TL;DR - A Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a data structure that can be replicated across multiple nodes and independently updated — then merged into a consistent state without coordination or conflict resolution, because its operations are mathematically designed to be commutative, associative, and idempotent.

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Two users edit a shared document simultaneously. User A increments a counter from 5 to 6. User B also increments from 5 to 6. Both replicas sync. What is the final value? If we naively apply both updates: we might get 6 (only one increment counted) or 7 (both counted) depending on merge strategy. We need a human to resolve the conflict — or we silently lose one update. At scale: Google Docs had to build a complex Operational Transform engine to handle this. CouchDB uses multi-value conflict storage requiring application-layer resolution. DynamoDB stores conflicting versions for application-layer resolution.

**THE BREAKING POINT:**
Collaborative editing (Google Docs, Notion, Figma), distributed databases (Cassandra counters, Redis Enterprise), and offline-first apps (mobile apps with local-first sync) all share the same fundamental problem: concurrent writes to shared state on disconnected replicas WILL conflict. Every architecture that involves multi-master replication or offline editing must answer: "What happens when two nodes independently modify the same data?" Traditional answers: (1) lock before write (kills availability), (2) coordinate consensus (slow, requires quorum), (3) accept conflicts and resolve later (user experience degrades). CRDT is a fourth answer: design data structures where conflicts are mathematically impossible.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
Marc Shapiro, Nuno Preguiça, Carlos Baquero, and Marek Zawirski published the foundational CRDT paper "Conflict-free Replicated Data Types" in 2011 (SSS'11), though earlier work on lattice-based data structures dates to the 1990s. The key insight: if you design data structure operations to satisfy mathematical properties (commutativity, associativity, idempotency), then any sequence or order of merging concurrent updates produces the same final state. No coordination, no conflict resolution, no human intervention.

**EVOLUTION:**
2011: Shapiro et al. — formal CRDT taxonomy (state-based CvRDT, operation-based CmRDT). 2013: Riak 2.0 — first major distributed database with built-in CRDT types. 2014: Yjs library — CRDT for collaborative text editing in browsers. 2018: Automerge — JSON CRDT for offline-first apps. 2019: Redis Enterprise CRDT data types (Active-Active replication). 2020+: CRDTs adopted in Figma (collaborative design), Linear (project management), and Loom. Today: CRDTs are the standard approach for conflict-free collaborative and offline-first applications.

### 📘 Textbook Definition

A **Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)** is a data structure with mathematically proven merge properties that guarantee eventual consistency across replicas without coordination. There are two main families: **State-based CRDTs (CvRDTs):** replicas exchange full state; merge function is a join operation on a semilattice (commutative, associative, idempotent). Any two states can be merged in any order, any number of times, always producing the same result. **Operation-based CRDTs (CmRDTs):** replicas exchange operations; operations must be commutative (and typically idempotent); requires causal delivery ordering. **Mathematical foundation:** semilattice — a partial order where every pair of elements has a least upper bound (LUB). The merge function computes the LUB. Idempotency: merge(A, A) = A. Commutativity: merge(A, B) = merge(B, A). Associativity: merge(merge(A, B), C) = merge(A, merge(B, C)). These three properties together guarantee: regardless of the ORDER replicas are merged, the result is the same.

### ⏱️ Understand It in 30 Seconds

**One line:** CRDTs are data structures where merging any combination of concurrent updates always produces the same correct result — no conflicts possible by design.

> A CRDT is like a voting tally sheet where each region has its own ballot box. Each region independently counts its ballots and reports its subtotal. To get the national total: just add all regional subtotals. It doesn't matter what order you add them. It doesn't matter if one region reports twice. The math always works out: the national total is the same. Compare this to a single shared ballot box where voters must line up one-by-one (coordination) — CRDTs replace coordination with mathematical structure.

**One insight:** CRDTs don't "resolve" conflicts — they design data structures where conflicts are mathematically impossible. The trade-off: you can only use CRDT operations (add, not arbitrary replace), which limits the kinds of state changes you can represent.

---

### 🔩 First Principles Explanation

**CORE INVARIANTS:**
1. **Semilattice structure.** Every CRDT's state space forms a join-semilattice: a partial order where every pair of states has a unique least upper bound (LUB). The LUB is the merge result. Because there's always exactly ONE LUB for any two states: merge is deterministic regardless of order.
2. **Monotonic state growth.** State-based CRDTs (CvRDTs): state only moves UP the lattice (never down). Operations only increase the state. This is the key restriction: you cannot delete (directly) from a G-Set, only add. Deletions require separate data structures (tombstones).
3. **Causal ordering for op-based CRDTs.** Operation-based CRDTs (CmRDTs): operations must be delivered causally (a message is only delivered after all messages it causally depends on are delivered). This ensures operations are applied in a consistent relative order across replicas.
4. **Idempotent merge.** merge(A, A) = A. If the same state update is received twice (network duplicate delivery): the result is the same as receiving it once. This enables at-least-once delivery without duplicates corrupting state.

**DERIVED DESIGN - Key CRDT types:**
```
G-Counter (Grow-only Counter):
  State: {node_id -> count} map
  Increment: state[myNodeId]++
  Merge: merge(A, B)[i] = max(A[i], B[i])
  Value: sum(state.values())
  Conflict-free: max() is idempotent+commutative+associative

PN-Counter (Positive-Negative Counter):
  State: {pos: G-Counter, neg: G-Counter}
  Increment: pos.increment()
  Decrement: neg.increment()
  Merge: merge pos and neg independently
  Value: pos.value() - neg.value()

G-Set (Grow-only Set):
  State: {element -> boolean}
  Add: state.add(element)
  Merge: state = A.union(B)
  Conflict-free: set union is idempotent+commutative

OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set):
  Problem with 2P-Set: add after remove loses data
  Solution: each add operation gets a unique tag
    add("a") -> {("a", tag1)}
    remove("a") removes tag1 only, not future adds
  Merge: merge tags from both replicas
  Result: element present if any add tags not removed

LWW-Register (Last-Write-Wins):
  State: {value, timestamp}
  Write: {value, now()}
  Merge: pick higher timestamp
  Risk: timestamp skew can cause data loss
         (correctly ordered writes can be "lost")

MVCC-Register (Multi-Value):
  State: {value -> vector_clock}
  Write: {value, increment_vector_clock()}
  Merge: keep all concurrent values (conflict!)
  Read: returns all concurrent values for app resolution
  (Riak's approach -- not truly conflict-free)
```

**THE TRADE-OFFS:**
**Gain:** Conflict-free merging. No coordination required. Works offline. Works during network partitions. Strong eventual consistency (all replicas that receive the same updates converge to the same state).
**Cost:** Data structure expressiveness is limited (only CRDT-compatible operations). Tombstones required for deletions. State can grow unboundedly (G-Counters accumulate node entries). Garbage collection (pruning old tombstones) requires coordination. Sequence CRDTs (for text) are complex and have performance challenges at large document size.

**ESSENTIAL vs ACCIDENTAL COMPLEXITY:**
**Essential:** The restriction to monotonic operations (state only grows) is inherent to the CRDT guarantee. Deletion of data in a distributed system REQUIRES some form of coordination (or tombstone + GC) — this is irreducible.
**Accidental:** Specific tombstone formats, vector clock implementations, causal delivery middleware. These are engineering choices within the CRDT model.

### 🧪 Thought Experiment

**SETUP:** You're building a collaborative like counter for a social app. Users can like/unlike posts. The counter must work offline (mobile), sync when reconnected, and handle concurrent updates from multiple devices.

**Without CRDT (naive last-write-wins counter):**
```
Server: count=10
Device A (offline): likes post -> count=11
Device B (offline): likes post -> count=11
Sync: A reports 11, B reports 11
Which is correct? LWW picks one -> count=11 (lost a like)
User: "I liked this and the count didn't go up!"
```
One user's like is silently lost.

**With PN-Counter CRDT:**
```
Server: {A:5, B:5} (each device's contribution)
Device A (offline): pos[A]++ -> pos[A]=6, pos[B]=5
Device B (offline): pos[B]++ -> pos[A]=5, pos[B]=6
Sync: merge = max per device:
  merged: {A:6, B:6}
  value = 6 + 6 = 12 (both likes counted!)
```
Both likes are preserved. No conflict. No coordination needed.

**THE INSIGHT:** The CRDT works by changing the data structure from "current count" to "per-node contribution." Each device owns its increment. Merging is simply taking the maximum per-device contribution. You can never "lose" an increment because each device's contribution is independently tracked.

---

### 🧠 Mental Model / Analogy

> A CRDT is like a bag of colored marbles where each person adds their own color. Person A adds 3 blue marbles. Person B adds 2 red marbles — simultaneously, without knowing about A. When they meet: combine the bags. The result is always 3 blue + 2 red = 5 marbles, regardless of who shows up first. No conflict: A's blue marbles and B's red marbles don't interfere. The "merge" is just combining bags (union). Removing marbles requires a different rule: put them in a "removed" bag and subtract — still no conflict.

**Mapping:**
- **Each person's colored marbles** -> each node's contribution to CRDT state
- **Combining bags** -> CRDT merge (join operation / LUB)
- **Any order of combining** -> commutativity + associativity
- **Adding same marbles twice** -> idempotency (duplicate delivery safe)
- **Removing marbles (tombstone bag)** -> OR-Set approach for deletions

Where this analogy breaks down: in real CRDTs, operations must be causally ordered for op-based CRDTs. "Combining bags" suggests independence, but some operations (add-then-remove in OR-Set) require knowing which add the remove refers to.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Four Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
CRDTs are a special kind of data structure designed for apps where multiple people edit the same data simultaneously without internet (offline). They're designed so that no matter what order everyone's changes are combined, the result is always the same correct answer. Like counting votes: even if you count regions in different orders, the total is always the same.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**
Use a CRDT library rather than implementing from scratch. JavaScript: Yjs (collaborative editing), Automerge (JSON documents). Java/Scala: akka-distributed-data (includes G-Counter, PN-Counter, G-Set, OR-Set). Redis Enterprise: built-in CRDT types. Use G-Counter for incrementing counters, OR-Set for collaborative sets, Sequence CRDTs (Yjs) for collaborative text.

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**
State-based CRDT merge example (G-Counter):
```java
class GCounter {
    Map<String, Long> state = new HashMap<>();
    String nodeId;

    void increment() {
        state.merge(nodeId, 1L, Long::sum);
    }

    GCounter merge(GCounter other) {
        GCounter result = new GCounter(nodeId);
        Set<String> allKeys = new HashSet<>(state.keySet());
        allKeys.addAll(other.state.keySet());
        for (String key : allKeys) {
            result.state.put(key, Math.max(
                state.getOrDefault(key, 0L),
                other.state.getOrDefault(key, 0L)
            ));
        }
        return result;
    }

    long value() {
        return state.values().stream()
            .mapToLong(Long::longValue).sum();
    }
}
// Merge is: max per node entry
// Idempotent: merge(A, A) = A
// Commutative: merge(A, B) = merge(B, A)
// Associative: merge(merge(A,B),C) = merge(A,merge(B,C))
```

**Level 4 - Why it was designed this way (senior/staff):**
CRDTs formalize a mathematical truth: if you restrict data structure operations to those that form a join-semilattice, you get conflict-free merging for free. The semilattice structure is what makes this work: every pair of states has a unique least upper bound (LUB), so "merge" is well-defined and deterministic. The restriction to semilattice operations (monotonic growth, no arbitrary replacement) is the price of the guarantee. This is a fundamental trade-off between expressiveness and consistency: arbitrary data structures (arbitrary reads/writes) require coordination for consistency; CRDT-restricted data structures (monotonic operations only) don't. Real-world CRDT design is about: (1) identifying what operations your application needs, (2) finding a semilattice representation that supports those operations, and (3) accepting the restrictions. Text editing CRDTs (RGA, YATA used in Yjs) are complex because sequences are inherently ordered — tracking concurrent insertions at the same position requires careful design to produce a consistent total order.

**Expert Thinking Cues:**
- "Our CRDT state is growing unboundedly — nodes are accumulating old tombstones" -> G-Set / OR-Set tombstones accumulate forever without GC. Tombstone GC requires coordination (all nodes must have processed the tombstone before it can be pruned). Options: (1) periodic GC with quorum acknowledgment (Riak's approach), (2) use LWW-Element-Set with expiring entries, (3) use operation-log compaction. Alert: unbounded growth is a correctness-adjacent concern — it won't break consistency but will degrade performance.
- "Two nodes merged their CRDT states but got different results" -> Either: (1) the merge function is buggy (not implementing LUB correctly), (2) the state is using non-monotonic operations (not a valid CvRDT), or (3) op-based CRDT has missing causal delivery (operations applied out of causal order). Validate: merge(A, B) == merge(B, A) and merge(A, A) == A for your implementation.
- "Users report that a delete didn't take effect on some devices" -> OR-Set issue: the delete removed specific add-tags, but the element was re-added with new tags on another device simultaneously. The re-add's tags survived the merge. This is correct OR-Set behavior: add wins over concurrent delete. If you need "delete wins": use 2P-Set (deletions are permanent) but accept that re-addition is impossible.

### ⚙️ How It Works (Mechanism)

**G-Counter merge (state-based CvRDT):**
```
Node A state: {A:3, B:2}    (A incremented 3, B incremented 2)
Node B state: {A:2, B:5}    (A incremented 2, B incremented 5)
[A and B were offline, diverged]

Merge: take max per entry:
  result: {A:max(3,2)=3, B:max(2,5)=5}
  value: 3 + 5 = 8

A's state before offline: {A:2, B:2} -> value=4
A incremented once offline: {A:3, B:2} -> value=5
B incremented 3 times offline: {A:2, B:5} -> value=7
After merge: {A:3, B:5} -> value=8
Correct! 4 total increments (A:1, B:3) -> 4+4=8. Wait...
Let's recount: A at start=4, A incremented 1 = +1
B at start=4, B incremented 3 = +3. Total = 4+1+3=8. ✓
```

**OR-Set (add-wins set):**
```
Initial: {} (empty)
Node A: add("apple") -> {("apple", tag:uuid1)}
Node B: remove("apple") [removes tag uuid1]
        add("apple") -> {("apple", tag:uuid2)}
[concurrent: A's add and B's remove+add]

Merge:
  A's set: {("apple", uuid1)}
  B's set: {("apple", uuid2)} [uuid1 removed]
  Merge: union of {uuid1, uuid2} - removed {uuid1}
  Result: {("apple", uuid2)} -- "apple" present!
  (B's re-add survived, A's original add's tag was removed)
```

### 🔄 The Complete Picture - End-to-End Flow

**OFFLINE EDIT -> SYNC -> MERGE:**

```
UserA(offline)  Replica A  Network  Replica B  UserB(offline)
      |              |         |         |             |
      |-edit doc---->|         |[partition]|            |
      |              | A edits  |         | B edits     |
      |              | (CRDT)   |         | (CRDT)      |<-edit doc-|
      |              |         |[reconnect]|            |
      |              |--state-->|-------->|             |
      |   <- YOU ARE HERE      |         |             |
      |              |<--state------------|             |
      |              |[merge: LUB]        |[merge: LUB] |
      |<-merged doc--|         |         |-merged doc-->|
      |[same result] |         |         |[same result] |
```

**FAILURE PATH:**
If Replica B's state message is lost (network issue): A and B eventually reconnect (gossip protocol, anti-entropy). Anti-entropy (DST-063) will detect state divergence and trigger a sync. CRDTs guarantee: whenever sync happens, merge produces the same result.

**WHAT CHANGES AT SCALE:**
At large documents (millions of characters in a text CRDT): sequence CRDT performance degrades (O(n) per operation in naive implementations). Solutions: (1) Yjs's optimized YATA algorithm with amortized O(1) per operation, (2) document sharding (different users own different sections), (3) operational transform fallback for very large documents. At large node counts: G-Counter state size = O(nodes). With 1000 nodes: 1000-entry map per G-Counter instance. Use compact vector clock representation (only non-zero entries).

---

### 💻 Code Example

**BAD - Naive concurrent counter (causes lost updates):**
```java
// BAD: last-write-wins on integer counter
// Concurrent increments cause lost updates
// No conflict resolution possible

@Entity
class Post {
    Long id;
    int likeCount; // DANGER: single integer
}

// Service A:
post.setLikeCount(post.getLikeCount() + 1); // read=10, write=11
// Service B (concurrent):
post.setLikeCount(post.getLikeCount() + 1); // read=10, write=11
// After sync: likeCount = 11 (one like lost!)
// At high scale: many likes silently lost
```

**GOOD - G-Counter CRDT (no lost updates):**
```java
// GOOD: G-Counter CRDT -- conflict-free counter
// Each node tracks its own contribution
// Merge: max per node (no conflicts possible)

class GCounter {
    private final Map<String, Long> counts =
        new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    private final String nodeId;

    public GCounter(String nodeId) {
        this.nodeId = nodeId;
    }

    // Increment own node's count
    public void increment() {
        counts.merge(nodeId, 1L, Long::sum);
    }

    // Merge: max per node entry
    public GCounter merge(GCounter other) {
        GCounter result = new GCounter(nodeId);
        result.counts.putAll(this.counts);
        other.counts.forEach((node, count) ->
            result.counts.merge(node, count, Math::max));
        return result;
    }

    public long value() {
        return counts.values().stream()
            .mapToLong(Long::longValue).sum();
    }
}

// Usage: two replicas independently increment
GCounter a = new GCounter("node-A");
GCounter b = new GCounter("node-B");
a.increment(); a.increment(); // a contributes 2
b.increment();               // b contributes 1
// After sync (any order):
GCounter merged = a.merge(b); // or b.merge(a)
// merged.value() == 3 -- always correct!

// How to test / verify correctness:
// - merge(A, A) == A (idempotent)
// - merge(A, B) == merge(B, A) (commutative)
// - merge(merge(A,B),C) == merge(A,merge(B,C)) (associative)
```

### ⚠️ Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality |
|:---|:---|
| "CRDTs solve all distributed data conflicts" | CRDTs solve conflicts for the specific operations they support (add, increment, union). They do NOT support arbitrary write semantics (replace, delete-then-re-add with old value). Many application semantics cannot be expressed as CRDT operations without redesigning the data model. If your data requires arbitrary updates (UPDATE SET name=X WHERE id=Y), a CRDT may not fit. The trade-off: conflict-free guarantees require accepting operation restrictions. |
| "CRDTs don't require any coordination" | State-based CRDTs don't require coordination for MERGING. But they may require coordination for: (1) garbage collection of tombstones (require all nodes to have seen a tombstone before pruning), (2) generating unique IDs (requires coordination or UUID generation), (3) intent operations in sequence CRDTs (relative position operations). Op-based CRDTs require causal delivery ordering — typically implemented with vector clocks requiring some coordination. |
| "Last-Write-Wins is a CRDT" | LWW-Register is technically a CRDT (merge = max timestamp = LUB). But it can lose data: if two writes happen simultaneously, the lower-timestamp write is silently discarded. This is mathematically correct (the LUB picks the higher timestamp) but semantically wrong for most applications (user's write is lost). The mathematical guarantee of CRDTs is eventual consistency — not "all user intentions preserved." LWW-Register is a CRDT that sacrifices user intent for simplicity. |
| "CRDTs guarantee strong consistency" | CRDTs guarantee STRONG EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY (SEC): once all nodes have received the same set of updates, they all have the same state. This is stronger than basic eventual consistency (which only guarantees convergence eventually) but weaker than strong consistency (linearizability, which requires all reads reflecting all previous writes). A replica that hasn't received all updates may return stale data. CRDTs don't require reads to go through a quorum. |

### 🚨 Failure Modes & Diagnosis

**Failure Mode 1: Tombstone Accumulation Causes OOM / Performance Degradation**

**Symptom:** A Riak cluster using OR-Set CRDTs for collaborative tag management starts experiencing slow writes and eventually OOM crashes on nodes. Monitoring shows: OR-Set state sizes growing to 500MB per key. Tombstone count per key: 10 million. The application allows users to add and remove tags frequently. Over 2 years: tombstones accumulated without GC.
**Root Cause:** OR-Set tombstones: every `remove(element)` adds a tombstone (the removed add-tag). Tombstones are never pruned without GC. GC requires coordination (all nodes must confirm seeing the tombstone). GC was never implemented. 2 years × 1 million removes/day = 730 million tombstones. State-based CvRDT sends FULL STATE on sync: 500MB per sync per key pair. Network saturation.
**Diagnostic:**
```bash
# Riak: check CRDT object size
riak-admin bucket-type status crdt_types
# Check object size distribution:
riak-admin stat | grep crdt_size

# Check OR-Set tombstone count (application-level):
riak_client.fetch("tags", key).value().tombstone_count()
# If millions: GC needed

# Check anti-entropy sync bandwidth (Riak):
riak-admin stat | grep "riak_kv_anti_entropy.*bytes"
# High bytes: large CRDT states causing network saturation
```
**Fix:** Implement tombstone GC: (1) track when all nodes have seen a tombstone (using vector clocks), (2) prune tombstones once all nodes confirm. Short-term: compact existing OR-Sets by snapshotting current live state (removing all tombstones) — requires brief coordination. Future: use 2P-Set (no tombstones, but re-addition is impossible) or LWW-Element-Set (expiring tombstones by timestamp).
**Prevention:** Set tombstone GC schedule in Riak (`delete_mode`, `tombstone_gc`). Monitor CRDT object size (alert if > 1MB per object). Use 2P-Set when re-addition of removed elements is not needed. Use LWW-Register instead of OR-Set for simple presence flags.

**Failure Mode 2: Op-Based CRDT Out-of-Order Delivery Causes State Divergence**

**Symptom:** A collaborative text editor using an op-based sequence CRDT (CmRDT) produces different document states on different clients after syncing. Client A sees "Hello World", Client B sees "Helo World" (missing 'l'). Both clients received all operations, but in different orders. The causal delivery requirement was not implemented correctly.
**Root Cause:** Op-based CRDTs require CAUSAL delivery: operation O2 is not delivered until all operations that causally preceded O2 have been delivered. If operations arrive out of causal order and are applied: the resulting state is incorrect. Causal delivery is typically implemented with vector clocks: O2's vector clock is [A:3, B:2] — don't deliver O2 until O1=[A:2, B:2] is delivered. Without this check: operations applied out of order -> diverged state.
**Diagnostic:**
```bash
# Check operation log for each client (application-level):
# List all operations with their vector clocks
SELECT op_id, vector_clock, operation_type
FROM crdt_ops
WHERE doc_id = '...'
ORDER BY applied_at;

# Look for gaps: if client A applied op[A:3,B:2]
# but op[A:2,B:2] is missing: out-of-order delivery

# Check causal delivery middleware logs:
grep "causal-delivery\|missing-dep\|held-back" \
  crdt-sync.log
# "held-back" messages: operations waiting for causal deps
```
**Fix:** Implement causal delivery: before applying an operation, verify all causally preceding operations have been applied (check vector clock of incoming op against local vector clock). If causal deps missing: buffer the operation until deps arrive. Use a proven causal delivery library (e.g., Yjs uses Y.js's causal broadcast protocol).
**Prevention:** Use state-based CRDTs (CvRDTs) instead of op-based CRDTs when causal delivery is difficult to implement. CvRDTs only require eventual delivery of full state — no causal ordering required. The price: larger messages (full state) vs operation-based (small operation messages). For collaborative text: use Yjs (well-tested causal delivery) rather than custom implementation.

**Failure Mode 3: Security - Malicious CRDT State Injection Causes Unbounded Growth**

**Symptom:** A distributed system using state-based G-Counter CRDTs accepts CRDT state merges from other nodes. An attacker gains access to one node and sends malformed CRDT states claiming astronomical counts for their node: `{attacker_node: 10^18}`. After merge (max per node): the G-Counter's value jumps to 10^18. All legitimate counter reads now return a number larger than any real count. Business logic breaks: rate limiters that compare counter values to thresholds all evaluate to "limit exceeded" permanently.
**Root Cause:** CRDT merge operation accepts state without validation. The G-Counter's merge (max per node) is designed for honest nodes — there's no built-in mechanism to reject false state claims. A Byzantine node (DST-059) can inject any state value into the merged CRDT. CRDTs assume non-Byzantine failure model (crash failures, not malicious behavior).
**Diagnostic:**
```bash
# Check G-Counter state for anomalous values:
# Application-level inspection of CRDT state:
crdt_client.inspect("rate-limit-counter") | \
  python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin);
  print([(k,v) for k,v in d.items() if v > 10**12])"
# Large values from specific nodes: potential injection

# Check which nodes submitted the large state:
grep "crdt-sync.*from=attacker_node" sync.log | \
  awk '{print $timestamp, $state_size, $max_value}'
```
**Fix:** Validate CRDT state before merging: reject state with values exceeding physically possible bounds (e.g., a counter for hourly requests cannot exceed max_requests_per_second * 3600). Authenticate CRDT state messages with node identity + signature (mTLS between nodes). Rate-limit CRDT state submissions per node. On detection of anomalous state: quarantine the node, alert on-call, revert CRDT state to last known-good snapshot.
**Prevention:** CRDTs are not designed for Byzantine fault tolerance. Use CRDTs only in trusted environments (internal cluster nodes). For environments with untrusted nodes: use BFT-safe data structures (DST-059). Implement bounds checking on all CRDT merge operations. Sign CRDT state with node certificate — reject unsigned or unsigned-invalid state.

**If you remember only 3 things:**
1. CRDTs prevent conflicts by restricting operations to a mathematical structure (semilattice): merge is always idempotent, commutative, and associative. Any order of merging produces the same result. The price: only monotonic (additive) operations are safe — arbitrary replacements and deletes require special handling (tombstones).
2. Two families: state-based (CvRDT) sends full state, merge = LUB; op-based (CmRDT) sends operations, requires causal delivery. State-based is simpler to implement correctly (no ordering requirement) but sends more data. Op-based is more efficient but requires causal broadcast middleware.
3. CRDTs are not magic: tombstones accumulate without GC (requires coordination), sequence CRDTs (for text) are complex with performance challenges, and CRDTs assume honest (non-Byzantine) nodes. CRDTs solve the conflict problem for their specific operation set — not a universal solution.

**Interview one-liner:**
"A CRDT is a data structure whose merge operation is idempotent, commutative, and associative — making it conflict-free: any sequence or order of merging concurrent updates always produces the same result. G-Counter example: state is a map of per-node counts; merge is max-per-node; value is sum. Concurrent increments from any nodes can be merged in any order without conflicts. Trade-off: only monotonic (additive) operations are safe — deletions require tombstones and periodic GC. Used in: collaborative editing (Yjs), offline-first apps (Automerge), distributed counters (Riak, Redis Enterprise)."

### 💎 Transferable Wisdom

**Reusable Engineering Principle:**
When coordination is expensive, change what you compute. CRDTs shift from "compute the current value" (requires coordination to reconcile conflicts) to "compute the merge of all contributions" (no coordination needed, just combine). The pattern: identify what mathematical structure your computation can be expressed as. If it fits a semilattice: distribute it conflict-free. If it doesn't: you need coordination. This principle applies to: distributed aggregations (use commutative, associative accumulators like Spark's `reduce`), distributed logging (append-only logs are a CRDT — sequence of immutable events), and distributed bloom filters (union of bit arrays is a CRDT — used in distributed membership queries).

**Where else this pattern appears:**
- **DNS: eventual consistency via monotonic updates.** DNS record propagation is a CRDT-like system: each DNS server holds its current view of records. TTL-expired records are pruned (local compaction). New records propagate via zone transfers (merge = union of records; newer TTL wins for same record). DNS never "rolls back" a record to an older value — new records only move records toward more recent state. This monotonic property makes DNS self-healing: eventually all servers converge to the current zone file without coordination. DNS doesn't call itself a CRDT — but its convergence property IS the CRDT property.
- **Git merge: semilattice on commit DAG.** Git's commit history forms a DAG (directed acyclic graph). A merge commit computes the LUB of two commit histories — the common ancestor is the meet of the two histories in the commit lattice. Git's "fast-forward" merge is exactly the LUB operation on a linear history. The 3-way merge algorithm extends this to file content. Git conflicts arise when the file content doesn't form a clean semilattice (the same line was modified in both branches) — this is precisely where the "semilattice" property breaks down, requiring human conflict resolution. CRDTs are what you get when you design your data structure so that Git-style conflicts can NEVER arise.
- **Google Analytics: distributed event counting.** Google Analytics counts page views from billions of sessions daily. Each data center independently increments counters. Periodically: data centers sync and merge counts. The merge is: add all contributions (G-Counter style). There's no "master" counter — all data centers contribute and the global count is the sum. This is exactly the G-Counter CRDT pattern: each data center owns its contribution; global value is sum of all contributions; merge is max-per-datacenter. Analytics at this scale REQUIRES CRDT-like semantics — no single coordinator could handle the write throughput.

### 💡 The Surprising Truth

CRDTs were invented as a theoretical data structure in 2011. Their first major practical adoption was in distributed databases (Riak 2.0, 2013) for conflict-free counters and sets. But the most widely used CRDT implementation today is not in a database — it's in **text editors and collaborative writing tools**. Yjs (a JavaScript CRDT library) is used by VS Code's collaborative editing (Live Share), Jupyter notebooks, Tiptap (used by major document editors), and dozens of other tools. The Y.js CRDT library has over 5 million weekly npm downloads. The surprising truth: **the technology that keeps your code editor's collaborative features working without conflicts is the same mathematical structure used in distributed database systems** — a lattice-algebraic data structure originally designed for distributed databases is now the backbone of real-time collaborative editing across the web. The path from "peer-reviewed distributed systems paper" to "browser text editor library" took less than 10 years.

### 🧠 Think About This Before We Continue

**Q1 (E - First Principles):** OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set) is more complex than G-Set (Grow-only Set) because it needs to support removals. OR-Set uses unique tags per add operation to track which adds have been removed. Why is the simpler 2P-Set (Two-Phase Set: one G-Set for additions, one G-Set for removals) insufficient for most real-world applications? What specific scenario does OR-Set handle correctly that 2P-Set cannot?
*Hint:* 2P-Set: an element is present if it's in the add-set AND not in the remove-set. Removal is permanent — once an element is in the remove-set, it can never be added back (the remove-set is a G-Set: additions only). Problematic scenario: User A adds "apple" to a collaborative shopping list. User B removes "apple" simultaneously. Then (offline) User A re-adds "apple" (different grocery trip). In 2P-Set: "apple" was added to the remove-set (by B's remove). User A's re-add (same element "apple") conflicts with the permanent removal — the re-add is rejected. "apple" is permanently absent. OR-Set solution: each add gets a unique tag. User A's first add: ("apple", tag1). B's remove removes tag1. User A's second add: ("apple", tag2). Merge: tag1 is removed, tag2 is present -> "apple" is present. The re-add succeeds because it has a different tag. 2P-Set doesn't distinguish "add at time T1" from "add at time T2" — both additions of "apple" are treated as the same element. OR-Set tags distinguish them.

**Q2 (B - Scale):** A collaborative document editor uses Yjs (sequence CRDT) with 1000 concurrent users on the same document. The document is a 100,000-character article. Each user makes an average of 10 edits/second. Estimate: (a) the volume of CRDT operations per second, (b) the state vector size each client must maintain, (c) what happens to performance at this scale, and (d) what architectural changes would help?
*Hint:* (a) 1000 users × 10 ops/sec = 10,000 CRDT operations/second across the system. Each op must be broadcast to all other users: 10,000 × 1000 = 10 million op deliveries/second total. With WebSocket: each client receives 10,000 - 10 = 9,990 ops/sec from others. (b) Yjs vector clock: one entry per client (to track causal ordering). 1000 clients = 1000-entry vector clock per operation. Each sync message includes the vector clock. (c) Performance issues: O(n) per-insertion in naive sequence CRDTs (Yjs uses optimized YATA: amortized O(1) but degrades with concurrent inserts at same position). At 10,000 concurrent inserts/second: position conflicts -> O(n) worst case. Document size 100,000 chars: traversal overhead. Vector clocks with 1000 entries: memory and comparison overhead. (d) Architectural changes: (1) document sharding (split the 100,000-char doc into sections owned by different sub-groups), (2) hierarchical CRDT broadcast (cluster users into groups of 50, sync within group first, then cross-group), (3) rate limiting per user (10 ops/sec -> 2 ops/sec for very large sessions), (4) operational transform for very large docs (OT handles large-n better at the cost of needing a coordinator). In practice: collaborative editing tools (Google Docs, Notion) limit concurrent users per document to 50-200 for this reason.

**Q3 (C - Design Trade-off):** A mobile app has a local-first architecture: all data is stored on-device as CRDTs (Automerge), synced to a server when online. A user profile includes: name (string), age (integer), email (string), profile picture (binary blob). Which of these fields are suitable for CRDT representation, and which require special handling? What happens if two devices update the same field simultaneously?
*Hint:* Name (string): LWW-Register is simplest (last write wins — pick higher timestamp). But if User A changes first name and User B changes last name simultaneously: LWW picks one entire name string, losing the other change. Better: split into first_name and last_name as separate LWW-Registers, or use text CRDT (Automerge sequence) for character-level merge. Age (integer): LWW-Register works if age is set (not incremented). But if the app lets users set age: two devices simultaneously setting age=25 and age=30 -> LWW picks one. The "correct" answer is ambiguous (user intent is unclear). Consider: is age user-settable (use LWW) or system-computed (compute on server from birthdate — no CRDT needed)? Email: LWW-Register. But: email is a unique identifier. Simultaneous change on two devices = likely intentional on each. LWW loses one change silently. Better: use Multi-Value register (store both emails, prompt user to resolve). Profile picture (binary blob): NOT suitable for CRDT merge. Binary blobs don't have meaningful merge semantics. LWW is the only option (pick newer blob). Large blob syncing is a separate concern (S3-like storage, reference in CRDT). The general insight: CRDTs fit naturally for additive data (lists, counters, presence sets). For substitutive data (you're replacing the value, not adding to it): LWW or Multi-Value is the only option — and LWW silently loses data while Multi-Value requires application-level resolution.
